User Sync, from Adobe, is a command-line tool that moves user and
group information from your organization's enterprise directory
system (such as an Active Directory or other LDAP system) to your
organization's directory in the Adobe Admin Console.

Each time you run User Sync, it looks for differences between the
user and group information in the two systems, and updates the
Adobe directory to match the information in your directory.

This site provides all the documentation you need to configure
and use User Sync for your organization.
